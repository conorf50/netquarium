# netquarium
A kind of pointless "smart" aquarium monitoring system.
# Why would I want to monitor an aquarium?
For most people, this setup is overkill. But if you are a 'hardcore' fish keeper, then keeping tabs on multiple aquariums at once may be helpful.
# How do I install this?
This is an ongoing project so instructions are likely to change. 
# My fish died! It's your fault!
Many factors can cause that to happen.
