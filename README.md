# netquarium
A planned "smart" aquarium monitoring system based on commodity I.O.T hardware.
### Introduction:
Netquarium will allow a fishkeeper to remotely monitor an aquarium through the Internet using a web applicaton based on Javascript and MongoDB
### Is this necessary?
For most people, this setup is not necessary. But if you are a 'hardcore' fish keeper, then keeping tabs on multiple aquariums at once may be helpful.
### How do I install this?
This is an ongoing project so instructions are likely to change. 
### Will this kill my fish?
Many factors can cause that to happen.
